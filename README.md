# C Program Solutions and DSP Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of C programs ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced algorithms, with a special focus on Digital Signal Processing (DSP).

## Description

This repository is designed to serve as a resource for C programmers, students, and enthusiasts looking to explore and learn through practical examples. It covers:

* **Basic C Programming:** Solutions to common programming problems, including data structures, algorithms, and fundamental programming concepts.
* **Advanced C Programming:** Examples demonstrating advanced techniques, memory management, and optimization.
* **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** Implementations of various DSP algorithms, including filtering, transforms, and signal analysis.

The goal is to provide well-documented, easy-to-understand code that can be used as a learning tool or a starting point for more complex projects.

## Contents

* **`basic_programs/`:** Contains solutions to basic C programming problems.
* **`advanced_programs/`:** Includes examples of advanced C programming techniques.
* **`dsp/`:** Contains implementations of DSP algorithms.
